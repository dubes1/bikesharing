## Overview
Analyzing bikeshare data to find correlations for gender, age and times for usage and wear of Citi Bikes  
## Results  
1. Trips by start time
* Looking at the image below you can see that the most popular times are between 8-10 am and 5-7 pm which would mean that people are using the bikes to get to and from work

2. Average Trip duration by birth year  
* Looking at the image below you can see a rise in avg duration the younger the age starting with 1993 and on with one outlier being people who were born in 1969

3. Bike Utilization  
* This visualization is looking at bike Id's to identify which bikes are coming up on a need for service the larger the circle the longer the bike has been in use

4. Checkout time for users  
* Looking at the image below you can see that most people take out the bikes for short trips with the majority of the bikes being taken out for around 5 minutes

5. Checkout time by gender  
* building on the previous visualization the majority of riders are male

6. Checkout time by weekday  
* Further strengthening our hypothesis from the first visualization the majority of bikes are taken out on workdays not weekends at the times that people come and go from work

7. Trips by gender  
* Even more granularly it looks like the majority of the bikes on those days are being taken out by men

8. Trips by gender by weekday  
* This last image shows the strength of the disparity between men and women taking out the bikes

## Summary  
In conclusion it would seem that the bikes are being rented primarily by adult males to get to and from work. Another visualization I would look at is the avg age by start time and the avg age by weekday
